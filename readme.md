# Jar's Mouse Castbar   

Simple Cursor-attached cast bar for WoW.

See it in action here in combination with my Jar's Mouse Action Bar Addon. 

## Configuration

`/jmcb` opens up the configuration screen. You can:
* Scale the bar `length` 
* Scale the bar `width`
* Offset the X and Y relationship to the mouse cursor.
* Set the bar style as Horizontal, Vertical, Or  Circular (Circular kinda sucks, atm).
* Show spell name, etc.

If you set the Bar style for Vertical, than `length` and `width` essentiall flip 90 degrees.
